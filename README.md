## Short tut on MEAN stack

I wrote this simple app to learn teach my class on how to use nodejs to build **CRUD** application :simple_smile:
We were able to achieve some milestone, while we still have few things in our todo to make a complete **CRUD** app.


@todo

- [x] Create records in mongo db database
- [x] List record from database
- [ ] Edit records from database
- [ ] Delete records from database

We followed @zellwk [tutorial to complete](https://zellwk.com/blog/crud-express-mongodb/) the first part.

Much :heart:
